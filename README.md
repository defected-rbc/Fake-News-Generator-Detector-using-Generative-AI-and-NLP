Fake News Generator & Detector
Project Overview
In an era dominated by digital information, the rapid spread of misinformation, commonly known as "fake news," poses significant challenges to public trust and societal discourse. This project presents a dual-component AI system designed to address this issue: a Fake News Detector and a Text Generator. The Detector leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify news articles as real or fake, while the Text Generator showcases the capabilities of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) by producing human-like text. Developed as a prototype in a Google Colaboratory environment, this project demonstrates foundational AI/NLP principles crucial for understanding and combating misinformation.

Features
Fake News Detector:

Classifies news articles as "REAL" or "FAKE."

Utilizes a pre-trained BERT model (bert-base-uncased) for robust text classification.

Processes news data from fake.csv and true.csv datasets.

Text Generator:

Generates plausible-sounding news headlines based on user-defined prompts.

Employs a pre-trained GPT-2 model for human-like text generation.

Integrated Demonstration: Shows the full cycle by generating a fake headline and then attempting to detect it.

Ethical Discussion: Highlights the ethical implications of generative AI and the importance of detection mechanisms.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Hugging Face Transformers: For pre-trained GPT-2 and BERT models.

pandas: For data manipulation.

scikit-learn: For data splitting.

torch: The underlying deep learning framework.

Google Colaboratory: The development environment, providing GPU acceleration.

Setup and Usage (Google Colab)
To run this project, follow these steps in a Google Colab notebook:

Open a New Colab Notebook: Go to Google Colab and create a new notebook.

Upload Data:

Create a folder named data in your Colab environment (e.g., using the file explorer on the left sidebar).

Upload your fake.csv and true.csv files into this data folder.

(Optional: If you need to download the Kaggle dataset, uncomment and run the Kaggle API commands in the "Setup and Data Loading" section of the notebook, ensuring you have your kaggle.json file uploaded.)

Run the Notebook Cells: Copy and paste the code from the provided Google Colab notebook into your Colab cells and run them sequentially.

The notebook is divided into sections:

1. Setup and Data Loading: Installs libraries, loads fake.csv and true.csv, combines them, and prepares the data.

2. GPT-2 for Headline Generation: Loads GPT-2 and demonstrates headline generation.

3. BERT for Fake News Detection: Loads BERT, prepares data for it, and demonstrates classification.

4. Integration and Ethical Discussion: Combines generation and detection, followed by ethical considerations.

Challenges Faced
Computational Resources: Managing the high computational demands of large language models was a key challenge. This was addressed by leveraging Google Colab's GPU, using smaller batch sizes, and focusing on inference for BERT rather than full fine-tuning.

Data Integration: Combining two separate CSV files (fake.csv and true.csv) into a unified dataset with correct labeling required careful handling. This was resolved by programmatic label assignment and robust data loading logic with a dummy data fallback.

GPT-2 Tokenizer Warnings: A warning regarding GPT-2's padding token being identical to its end-of-sequence token was noted. While not critical for this demonstration, it highlights a nuance in model usage.

Future Work
Complete Fine-tuning for BERT: Fine-tuning the BERT model on the specific fake.csv and true.csv datasets to significantly improve detection accuracy and allow for comprehensive evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-score).

Fine-tuning for GPT-2: Fine-tuning GPT-2 on a corpus of fake news to enable it to generate more stylistically authentic and nuanced fake news content, further challenging the detection model.

Interactive Web Application: Developing a user-friendly web interface (e.g., using Streamlit or Flask) to seamlessly integrate both the detector and generator, making the tools accessible to a wider audience.

Advanced Model Exploration: Investigating more sophisticated NLP models (e.g., RoBERTa for detection, larger generative models for generation) for improved performance and realism.

Ethical Safeguards: Further exploring and implementing advanced safeguards, such as digital watermarking for generated content or integrating explainability features, to ensure responsible use of the generative component and enhance trust in the detection system.
